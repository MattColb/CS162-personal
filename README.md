This is the repository that I made that includes a lot of the work that I have done in following along with UC-Berkeley's CS162 Operating Systems Course
I mainly focused on the individual assignments, while also leveraging existing examples to help with the projects (especially around header files). 
I generally felt more comfortable in rust than in C, which is mostly why I chose to do assignments in rust where I could, but began to feel more comfortable with C over my time in this course. 
I also read the 2nd Edition of Thoman Anderson & Michael Dahlin's Operating System Principles & Practice Book and followed along with publicly available lectures posted by John Kubiatowicz on YouTube, which closely followed topics covered in the textbook with more detail where it was necessary.
