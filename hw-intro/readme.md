This was the first homework that I worked on that worked as a (re)introduction to C, the GNU Debugger, and other useful tools such as man and make.

The first program was a program that could display total word count and frequency count.

There was also a program that helped to find limits of system resources such as stack size, process limit, and number of file descriptors

Finally, there was an exercise in how to use the GNU compiler
