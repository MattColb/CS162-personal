This assignment was a practice in how to use the list data structure that pintos uses, which was a doubly linked list. It works on a very similar problem to the previous assignment, which is to count the frequency of each word.

This assignment also started to introduce threads, with a sample program `pthread.c` that showed that threads don't always run in order every time.

It then combined these two concepts, finding a way to synchronize multiple threads that are all working on to solve the frequency count problem in the pintos list data structure
